"""Fixed reference data for the team match play competition.

Short names mapped to register names, and the published fixture list.

The team sheets use nicknames; the register uses full names. This map is
the only place that correspondence is written down - it used to live in
comments inside data.js, where a regeneration would have erased it.

SCHEDULE is the published 10-week round robin: (week commencing, pairings).
Checked on entry - 100 pairings, every Team Yaseen player against every Team
Shufqat player exactly once, ten matches each week, every week a Monday. The
rules allow a match to be played ahead of its week, so a result can appear
before its scheduled date; that is expected, not an error.
