"""Team match results from the captains' Google Form, resolved into a match list.

    python results_import.py                 read the live form, report, write nothing
    python results_import.py --csv FILE      read a local CSV instead (for testing)
    python results_import.py --write         resolve, then regenerate data.js

WHY A FORM AND NOT THE WORKBOOK. Results used to be typed into the Match Log of
Team_Matchplay_Leaderboard.xlsx, which meant every result went through one
person at one PC. The captains are not at that PC and should not be editing a
formula-linked workbook in any case - one stray sort would misalign the whole
tracker. A form is a phone, a dropdown and no way to break anything.

APPEND-ONLY, LAST ONE WINS. A Google Form can only ever add a row, so amending
and deleting have to be expressed as later submissions that supersede earlier
ones. Every row names a FIXTURE - the two rostered players - and that is the
key, because in a round robin each pair meets exactly once. Rows are applied in
submission order and the last one for a fixture is the truth:

    Sending a result   set the result for that fixture, whether or not it
                       already had one
    Removing a result  the fixture goes back to unplayed

Nothing is ever edited or removed from the responses sheet. It is a log of what
was reported and when, and the site is the fold of it. If a captain fat-fingers
a score, they submit a Correction; the wrong row stays in the log, which is
what you want when someone asks why the score changed.

SUBSTITUTES, ONE PER SIDE. The fixture belongs to the rostered players, so the
form asks for them first and only then who actually played. That is the same distinction the
site draws - aSubFor is the team-mate stood in for - and it is why a result can
be matched to its scheduled week even when neither name on the card is the one
in the fixture list.

WHAT THIS REFUSES. A pairing that is not in the schedule, an unknown name, a
substitute from the wrong team or standing in for themselves, a score outside
0-27, which is what 9 holes of Stableford can produce. Those are reported and the row is dropped rather than published. Rule
4 no longer limits how many times a player may stand in (exception agreed
08/10/2026), so stand-in counts are neither reported nor enforced.

# the importer looks up is gone, and every run fails until it is taught the new
